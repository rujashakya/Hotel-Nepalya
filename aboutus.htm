  We see an organisation which aims at leadership in the hospitality industry by understanding its guests, and designing and delivering products and services which enable it to exceed their expectations. We will always demonstrate care for our customers through anticipation of their needs, attention to detail, distinctive excellence, warmth and concern.
  
  We see a lean, responsive organisation where decision making is encouraged at each level and which accepts change. An organisation that is committed and responsive to its guests and other stakeholders.
  
  Hotel Nepalaya might be one of the best hotel choices for you during your stay in Kathmandu. We are little different than other hotel’s in Nepal since we are integrating one hour to one-month yoga retreat and yoga teacher training courses in our hotel and classes will be held as per your time and requirement.

  Come and witness the magical aura of our hotel! Special offers on special days.
